# Vicmap2PGSQL

Python and OGR based importer for VicMap datasets to a PostGIS database.


## How to use it?

First, download the desired VicMap datasets. The download format should
be in ESRI Shapefile, GDA94 projection (note: this is the fastest format
which is generated by data.vic.gov.au and Spatial Datamart. Other formats
can take lengthy delays before the download is available.). Extract the
datasets, keeping the original directory structure (eg files will be split
into "VMPLAN\layer" and "VMPLAN\table").

Setup your connection parameters to the destination PostGIS database, eg
by setting the environment variables:

- PGHOST
- PGPORT
- PGDATABASE
- PGUSER
- PGPASSWORD

You also need to set an environment variable pointing to your OGR2OGR path,
eg
SET OGR2OGR=C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\ogr2ogr.exe
